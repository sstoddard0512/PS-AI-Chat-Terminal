"1","MODEL","[Adventure Game] The harsh glare of the binary sunset paints the desolate Martian landscape in shades of blood orange and bruised purple.  Dust devils whirl across the cracked regolith, carrying whispers of a forgotten civilization. Before you lies the wreckage of a derelict spaceship, its hull punctured and scarred, half-buried in the crimson sand.  A flickering emergency beacon pulses weakly from within the shattered cockpit.  Nearby, a rusted, metallic chest rests amongst the debris, its lock stubbornly intact.


1. Investigate the spaceship wreckage.
2. Try to open the metallic chest.
3. Follow the faint tracks leading away from the wreckage.
4. Attempt to repair the emergency beacon.

"2","MODEL","[Adventure Game] You approach the metallic chest, its surface pitted and worn by the harsh Martian elements.  The lock is complex, a series of interlocking gears and levers.  You try to pry it open with a rock you find nearby, but the metal is surprisingly resistant.  After several futile attempts, you notice a small, almost invisible panel on the underside of the chest.  A closer inspection reveals a series of symbols etched into the panel â€“ they look strangely familiar, almost like a simplified version of ancient Earth hieroglyphs.


1.  Try to decipher the symbols on the panel.
2.  Return to the spaceship wreckage.
3.  Ignore the chest and follow the tracks instead.

"3","MODEL","[Adventure Game] You spend several minutes studying the symbols on the chest's hidden panel.  They seem to represent a sequence of actions, a kind of code.  After much contemplation, a pattern emerges. You realize the symbols represent a sequence of lever manipulations.  Carefully, you retrace the sequence on the chest's lock, moving the levers in the order indicated by the symbols.  With a satisfying click, the chest springs open! Inside, you find a small, data crystal and a worn leather-bound journal.


1. Examine the data crystal.
2. Read the journal.
