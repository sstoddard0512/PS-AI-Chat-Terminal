Here's a vivid description of the image suitable for AI art generation:

A close-up portrait of a young woman with long, flowing blonde hair that cascades around her shoulders and partially obscures her neck.  Her hair is highlighted with strands of lighter blonde, giving it a sun-kissed, dimensional appearance.  The individual strands are subtly rendered with a soft, almost painterly, quality, suggesting movement and texture.

Her skin is fair, with delicate freckles scattered across her nose and cheeks, creating a natural, youthful look.  The skin has a luminous quality, suggesting a soft, even light source. There's a subtle blush on her cheeks, enhancing her complexion.  Her eyebrows are softly arched, framing bright, luminous green eyes that are intensely detailed; the color is a vibrant, almost emerald green.  The eyes themselves appear slightly downcast, giving her an air of gentle contemplation.

Her lips are full and softly parted, a natural light pink hue that complements her overall delicate features.  The shading and lighting on her face are very smooth and realistic, with soft shadows accentuating her cheekbones and jawline.  The overall feel is soft, dreamy and ethereal. The background is blurred and dark, drawing all attention to the woman's face and hair. The image should have a high level of detail and realism, akin to a high-resolution digital painting.

This is a great description! Here are a few options for AI art generation prompts, catering to different AI art generators:


**Option 1 (More concise, for generators like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion):**

`/imagine  Close-up portrait, young woman, long flowing blonde hair, sun-kissed highlights, freckles, luminous skin, emerald green eyes, downcast gaze, soft blush, full lips, dark blurred background,  high detail, realistic, digital painting, ethereal, dreamy`


**Option 2 (More detailed, for generators that respond well to extensive descriptions):**

`/imagine A hyperrealistic close-up portrait of a young woman with long, flowing blonde hair cascading around her shoulders. The hair features subtle, painterly highlights of a lighter blonde, suggesting movement and texture.  Her fair skin is delicately freckled across her nose and cheeks, illuminated by a soft, even light source, with a subtle blush. Her intensely detailed, luminous emerald green eyes are slightly downcast, conveying gentle contemplation.  Softly arched eyebrows frame her eyes. Her full lips are softly parted, a natural light pink. Smooth, realistic shading accentuates her cheekbones and jawline. The background is a dark, blurred bokeh. Style: high-resolution digital painting, ethereal, dreamy.  Focus on detail and realism.`


**Option 3 (Adding artistic influences for specific styles):**

`/imagine  Close-up portrait, young woman, long flowing blonde hair,  sun-kissed highlights, freckles, luminous skin, emerald green eyes, downcast gaze, soft blush, full lips, dark blurred background, high detail, realistic, digital painting, ethereal, dreamy,  in the style of Alphonse Mucha and Annie Leibovitz`  (This adds specific artist styles for influence.)


**Tips for using these prompts:**

* **Experiment with aspect ratios:**  Specify an aspect ratio (e.g., --ar 16:9) if your AI generator supports it.
* **Iteration:**  AI art generation is iterative.  Use the initial results as a starting point and refine your prompt based on the output.  Try adding or removing keywords to fine-tune the results.
* **Different AI generators:** Each generator has its own strengths and weaknesses.  Experiment with different platforms to see which one best captures your vision.


Remember to replace `/imagine` with the appropriate command for your chosen AI art generator.  Good luck!
